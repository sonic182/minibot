Long-term user memory for storing and recalling facts, preferences, and context that should persist across conversations.

Interpret "memory" requests as this long-term persistent user memory by default (including equivalent wording in other languages, for example "memoria").
Only switch to chat-history tools when the user explicitly asks about conversation/chat/messages history.

Use this tool proactively when the user request may depend on previously saved user context and you do not already have that context in the active conversation.

Priority policy:
- If context is likely relevant and missing, check memory before asking the user to repeat information.
- Do not call memory when the required context is already clear in the current conversation.

Use this to remember things about the user that are worth keeping: job, interests, goals, preferences, important dates, project details, or anything the user asks you to remember. Do NOT use this for conversation transcript storage; chat history is managed by chat_history tools.

Use the action field to select the operation:

- action=save: Store a new memory entry or update an existing one. Requires title (short label, max 100 chars) and data (the content to remember). Optional metadata (JSON object), source, and expires_at (ISO datetime). Use clear, searchable titles.

- action=get: Retrieve a specific entry by entry_id or title when you already know exactly which memory you need.

- action=search: Search across titles and data when you are unsure of exact IDs/titles. Prefer this first for contextual recall. Use a broad query and reasonably high limit when you need to quickly scan many memories.

- action=delete: Remove stale or outdated memory by entry_id or title when user asks to forget something or when replacing incorrect/outdated facts.
